        Intro: The world of Wizard101 PvP can be very complex and difficult to understand as it is always changing and shifting.
         Here I’ve compiled a guide that can serve as a help for how to get started with PvP early on, at level 59 for all the different schools of magic. 
    
         The Schools: The schools of magic are each focused on different aspects of magic and have different strengths and weaknesses. Fire for example excels at
     dealing damage over time on their enemies. Ice is proficient with shields and is great at defense. Storm is a heavy hitter that bolsters themselves with blades.
      Myth is especially known for their clever use of traps to hurt their opponents. Life has a focus on healing, and most specifically healing over time. Death deals
       by using weaknesses to reduce their opponents effectiveness. And Balance focuses on controlling the battlefield, while shifting things around in their favor. 
    
       Archmastery and Weaving: As a wizard in PvP you want to use archmastery to your advantage, being able to use pips as a casting source for another school's spells is
     key to finding the perfect moment to strike and use the enemies buffs against them. You want to keep switching up your pips to other schools so you have the advantage
      when a card comes up that you need to use. For example as a death wizard you might be using fire and ice pips which compliment death’s fighting style and can help you
       prepare for a more open hit on your enemy. Weaving is a newer addition that can help you enhance your combative skills even more. Being able to weave and fuse spells
        of different schools together opens up the possibilities of playing and using a dual school strategy where you can play up the strengths of two different schools and
         use those strengths to secure a win in PvP.

      <h3>Gear</h3>
      <p>
        The Right Gear: One of the hardest things starting out in PvP is the need for good gear that enhances your stats
         to the greatest you can make them so you don't fall behind other players. The best gear to get for almost any school
          at level 59 is the gear dropped from Malistaire in Dragonspyre. From Malistaire you can get the Hat, Robe, Boots,
           and Wand and even in the same dungeon you can get from the other bosses the Athame, Amulet, and Ring that is best
            suited to your school.

      <h3>Deckbuilding</h3>
      <p>
        Building the Right Deck: Building a deck for PvP is the most crucial thing a wizard can do. When you're starting out it can be pretty daunting
         and difficult to build a deck, but here are some basic guidelines: In your main deck try putting cards that have a gambit based on your strengths,
          cards that counter any type of enemies strengths (mostly focusing on shields and weaknesses), and any debuffing cards that may help you.
           In the side deck make sure to have plenty of tower shields and weaknesses, and have a few spirit and elemental shields, and lastly a couple bigger
            hitting cards for those emergency hits. 
        
            Strategies: The main strategy you should focus on at this lower level PvP is to get a Gambit card in hand after setting up the gambit. The main idea is that
        you focus on debuffing the enemy in some way so that you don’t get an open hit on you (meaning a hit with no debuffs), while setting up your gambit you should
          counter enemies gambits (a key component of this is watching what archmastery pips they are using, and taking into account what school they are based on the spells they cast),
          when you have an open hit you should take it immediately (this means you need to keep as many pips as you can for those open hits), and lastly if you have an open hit and your
            gambit set up take the hit.
