                    The world of Wizard101 PvP can be very complex and difficult to understand as it is always changing and shifting.
                    Here I’ve compiled a guide that can serve as a help for how to get started with PvP early on, at level 59 for all the different schools of magic. 
                
                    The Schools: The schools of magic are each focused on different aspects of magic and have different strengths and weaknesses. Fire for example excels at
                dealing damage over time on their enemies. Ice is proficient with shields and is great at defense. Storm is a heavy hitter that bolsters themselves with blades.
                Myth is especially known for their clever use of traps to hurt their opponents. Life has a focus on healing, and most specifically healing over time. Death deals
                by using weaknesses to reduce their opponents effectiveness. And Balance focuses on controlling the battlefield, while shifting things around in their favor. 
                
                Archmastery and Weaving: As a wizard in PvP you want to use archmastery to your advantage, being able to use pips as a casting source for another school's spells is
                key to finding the perfect moment to strike and use the enemies buffs against them. You want to keep switching up your pips to other schools so you have the advantage
                when a card comes up that you need to use. For example as a death wizard you might be using fire and ice pips which compliment death’s fighting style and can help you
                prepare for a more open hit on your enemy. Weaving is a newer addition that can help you enhance your combative skills even more. Being able to weave and fuse spells
                    of different schools together opens up the possibilities of playing and using a dual school strategy where you can play up the strengths of two different schools and
                    use those strengths to secure a win in PvP.
